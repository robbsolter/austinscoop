### Austin Scoop

Austin Scoop is a local Austin newspaper. We want to cover local stories about politics, land-use, business, technology,
food & beverage, and sports.

### Funding and Operations

Austin Scoop will be funded via the blockchain. We accept both advertisement and donations via an Ethereum smart contract.
Likewise, our writers are paid via disbersments from that smart contract.

This is radically different from most newspapers, it is somewhat of an experiment, but we feel like it could have a few
advantages if it takes off.

1. For donors, it is nice to know that your donations will go directly to the journalists. You even have the ability to donate 
directly to an individual journalist as well as the ability to donate to one section of the newspaper ( i.e. sports )

2. For writers, once you have published a story in the Austin Scoop, you will potentially receive payments for that article for the
lifetime of the Austin Scoop, as long as donations and revenue continue to flow to the contract , some percentage of that money will be 
disbersed to you.

3. For readers, there are no paywalls, and we think the open nature of this newspaper will build a unique community between 
  paper, writers, and readers.
