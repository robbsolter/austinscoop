## UT explodes for 13 runs in win over UTRGV

UT took to Disch Faulk field Tuesday night for some mid week inter league play against Rio Grande Valley. The bats were on fire in this one as Texas notched 13 runs including a 7 run 2nd inning to win the game handily 13-2. The Longhorn offense is not shy this year to production as they have seen a handful of games with 10+ runs.

Both Clemens and Hamilton knocked home runs and Longhorn pitcher Bocchi went 4 innings with 5 strikeouts and 2 runs earned.

Texas will next see action wednesday in Houston against Texas Southern.
