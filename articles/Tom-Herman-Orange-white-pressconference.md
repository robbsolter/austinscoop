Tom Herman was very happy with his team's performance Saturday night during the Orange and White game. Here were some notes on his comments:

1. He didn't really love the game format. He prefers a more fluid lineup instead of 2 set teams but he understands how fans like to see two distinct teams out there battling.

2. He blamed the format on some O-line struggles because the O-Line is not deep enough to truly have two groups playing, but he reiterated he is very happy with the line and they are going to be a great group.

3. He also took exception with a reporter's question about goaline sets. Herman said Texas did not want to show their full goaline sets in this game.

4. Lil Jordan Humphrey played a great game and should see some time in the wildcat this season. He doesn't have 'track' speed, but he is a really good football player.

5. He has seen some improvements with running backs, but no 'giant leaps'.

6. The defensive front 7 is 'woah'.

7. The freshman are very developed for their age.
